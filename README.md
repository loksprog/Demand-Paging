# Deman-Paging Memory Allocation Algorithm

Demand paging is a virtual memory technique where pages of a program are loaded into main memory only when they are actually needed, rather than all at once. This means the operating system brings pages from secondary storage (like a hard drive) into RAM only when a process tries to access a location on that page, a process called a "page fault". This approach reduces the time it takes to initialize a process and minimizes memory usage by only loading the pages that are actually needed.
